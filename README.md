# Superman
Use Only for Yourself
Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth.
As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm.
His ship landed in the American countryside, near the fictional town of Smallville.
He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent.
Clark developed various superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and impervious skin.
His foster parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante.
To protect his privacy, he changes into a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime.
